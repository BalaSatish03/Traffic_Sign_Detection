Autonomous vehicles heavily rely on accurate and timely detection of traffic signs
for safe navigation. In the process of traffic sign detection, the size of the objects 
and weather conditions exhibit significant variability, which can influence the 
detection accuracy. This project aims to enhance the robustness in detecting the 
traffic signs in challenging weather conditions through the implementation of the 
deep learning techniques
